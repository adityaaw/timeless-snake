## Timeless Snake: Privacy policy

This is an open source Android, iOS app built using React Native and the source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

As a dedicated Android user, I understand the importance of privacy. I know how frustrating it can be when apps collect data without your consent.

### Data collected by the app

To the best of my knowledge and belief, I confirm that this app does not collect any personally identifiable information. All data, such as app preferences like themes, are created by you, the user, and are stored locally on your device. You can easily erase this data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. Additionally, no analytics software is included in the app.

### Permissions requested by the app

This app does not request any permissions related to user data or device information, nor does it access any restricted or personal information.

If you discover any security vulnerabilities that may have been inadvertently caused by me, or if you have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, please email me or post a discussion on GitHub. I will do my best to address the issue and assist you.
